# Note Taker App

## Project Motivation
As part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp, challenge 11 is all about Express.js. Coming into the home stretch of the 6 months coding bootcamp with only two weeks to go, I realized we end in MERN - Mongo, Express, React, and Node. I had initially "missed" this "E" challenge, challenge 11. :astonished: But I want to finish with maximum understanding of all components. As such, I revisited challenge 11 to get it over the finish line. With that, here it is, the Note Taker app! It features notes routes to enter new notes and store them in a JSON object. :satisfied:

## Tech Used
This challenge features Express.js and Heroku

## Deployed App
